/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-generated
 * content is stored in a hierarchical structure under a top-level `/users` collection.
 * Access to any data within a specific user's data tree (`/users/{userId}`) is
 * granted exclusively to the authenticated user whose UID matches that `userId`.
 *
 * Data Structure: The primary data structure is `/users/{userId}/profile/{profileId}`.
 * This isolates all profile data for a given user under their unique identifier, making
 * security rules simple and efficient.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Listing Disabled: Listing the top-level `/users` collection is explicitly
 *   forbidden to protect user privacy and prevent data scraping.
 * - Path-Based Security: Authorization relies on the user's UID matching the `{userId}`
 *   parameter in the document path. This is highly performant as it avoids extra
 *   database reads (`get()` or `exists()` calls) within the rules.
 * - Client Deletion of User Root Disabled: Users cannot delete their own root document
 *   (`/users/{userId}`). This action is typically reserved for server-side administrative
 *   processes to ensure data integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The rules enforce that any document created within
 * a user's `profile` subcollection must contain an `id` field that matches the user's
 * UID from the path. This creates a durable and explicit ownership link within the data
 * itself, which is enforced as immutable on update. This ensures data integrity and
 * prevents a document from being moved or associated with another user.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Not applicable in this model, as all data is private user data
 * with a uniform access control policy.
