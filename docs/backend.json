    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to be simple and secure, focusing on user-owned data. It primarily stores user profiles.  Authorization Independence is achieved because there are no `get()` calls in the security rules; access is based solely on the `request.auth.uid` matching the `userId` path parameter.  The structure supports QAPs through path-based ownership, as only the authenticated user can access their own profile data, as enforced by security rules. This eliminates the need for complex filtering logic within the rules themselves. It uses `users/{userId}/profile` to associate profile documents with user IDs, enabling secure `list` operations because it naturally limits access to the user's specific data. It maintains invariants of ownership by directly associating data with the user's unique ID."
